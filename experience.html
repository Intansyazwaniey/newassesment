<p>WHAT am I gonna cook tomorrow. And the next day?” “What can i do during the MCO?? “I can’t go shopping with my mum?” “What? MCO has been extended?”
Yes, the wailings and angst that accompanied the announcement on TV that the MCO or Movement Control Order had been extended because we, Malaysians, have been terribly degil were most palpable. And yes, they came from me. But as the days have gone by, life has actually settled down to a pleasant equilibrium. I’m starting to enjoy the calm and the chance to spend more time with the family. And I love hearing the sounds of birds chirping gaily in the garden as opposed to the roar of the traffic. Here a few things that i learned from google during MCO. I can make a beautiful cake.

<p>My online learning experience as a student is not so good. I only like how I don’t have to wake up at 6 every day. What I don’t like about it is that for me it’s confusing when a teacher gives us work mostly since it’s easier for me to do work with instructions that the teacher gives. Being in a physical classroom makes me only focus on my work, but online learning makes it harder to focus because I have to also focus on household stuff, and it throws me off. I would not want to do online learning in the future because it is hard for me to concentrate on my work only.
